#In this SQL, I'm querying a database with multiple tables in it to quantify statistics about customer and order data.

#1 How many orders were placed in January? 

SELECT COUNT(orderID) 
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE length(orderID) = 6
AND  orderID <> 'Order ID';

#2 How many of those orders were for an iPhone? 

SELECT COUNT(orderID) 
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE length(orderID) = 6
AND  orderID <> 'Order ID'
AND Product = 'iPhone';

#3 Select the customer account numbers for all the orders that were placed in February.

SELECT  customers.acctnum 
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales FS
INNER JOIN BIT_DB.customers customers
ON FS.orderID = customers.order_id
WHERE length(orderID) = 6
AND  orderID <> 'Order ID';

#4 Which product was the cheapest one sold in January, and what was the price? 

SELECT Product, price 
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE length(orderID) = 6
AND  orderID <> 'Order ID'
ORDER BY price LIMIT 1;

#5 What is the total revenue for each product sold in January? (Revenue can be calculated using the number of products sold and the price of the products).

SELECT Product, SUM(Quantity)*price AS revenue
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE length(orderID) = 6
AND  orderID <> 'Order ID'
GROUP BY product;

#6 Which products were sold in February at 548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101, how many of each were sold, and what was the total revenue?

SELECT Product, SUM(Quantity) AS num_sold, SUM(Quantity)*price AS revenue
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales
WHERE length(orderID) = 6
AND  orderID <> 'Order ID'
AND location = '548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101'
GROUP BY product;

#7 How many customers ordered more than 2 products at a time in February, and what was the average amount spent for those customers?

SELECT COUNT(distinct cust.acctnum), AVG(Quantity)*price
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales fs
LEFT JOIN BIT_DB.customers cust
ON fs.orderID = cust.order_id
WHERE length(orderID) = 6
AND  orderID <> 'Order ID'
AND fs.Quantity>2;
